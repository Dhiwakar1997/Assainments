The above code defines a distance matrix called distances, which represents the distance between each pair of cities. It then uses the itertools.permutations() function to find all possible permutations of the cities, stored in the all_permutations variable. The script then loops through all permutations and calculates the total distance of each route by adding the distances between consecutive cities in the route. It then stores the shortest route and its distance in the shortest_route and shortest_distance variables, respectively. Finally, it prints out the results.

It's important to note that this brute force method is not efficient for large number of cities. The time complexity of this approach is O(n!) where n is the number of cities, which can be very slow for large values of n. There are other algorithms such as branch and bound, dynamic programming, and heuristics methods such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and ant colony optimization that are more efficient.
